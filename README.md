### Objectives

Collect the bling and deliver it to the drop zone. Score lots of points and avoid the bugs!

- **Game Navigation**
- - Press the spacebar to START, RESTART, PAUSE and RESUME the game.
- - Press 'i' to see the information screen from the Game Over and Game Win screens
- **Score Points**
- - You can collect any colour bling you like, but you must deliver it to the drop zone if you want to get points.
- - You can gain a point by reaching the water and be transported back to a start position
- **Lose Points and Lives!**
- - Watch out for the bugs! If you hit one, you'll lose a point and a life
- - if you're carrying Bling you'll lose half those points before you've even earned them!
- - also, don't go into the water holding bling as, again, you'll lose the points!
- **Levels**
- - When you've collected three blings of the same colour you can level up - start with blue :)
- **Lives**
- - You have 3 lives. If a bug hits you you lose 1 life and points - see above.

### Help
Game info is available on the Start screen, and can be reached again on the Game Over and Game Win screens

Enjoy the game and Good Luck!

### Future Improvements

I had such plans... but it was tough going at times. It's not the game I'd hoped it would be.
